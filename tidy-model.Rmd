## R Markdown test

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  ylab("Frequency")
```
```{r temp, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate") +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)') +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```
```{r species, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate for two species of crickets") +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)') +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)')

species_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp + species, data = crickets)
summary(species_lm)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
