## R Markdown test

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load data, include = FALSE}
data(crickets, package = "modeldata")
names(crickets)
```
## Introduction

This R Markdown document demonstrates my ability to use models for data analysis using a dataset collected on crickets.
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

## What is that sound?

In this report, we examine what factors predict a cricket's chirp rate.
```{r summary, echo = FALSE}
summary(crickets)
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 8, fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the chirp rate of crickets") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  ylab("Frequency")
```

## Temperature affects chirp rate
# Scatter Plot of Temperature vs. Chirp Rate
# This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between temperature and chirp rate.
# A linear regression line is added to highlight the trend.
```{r temp, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate") +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)') +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)')
```

# Linear Model for Chirp Rate Prediction
# This model quantifies the relationship between temperature and chirp rate.
temp_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp, data = crickets)

# Display summary statistics of the linear model
summary(temp_lm)
```{r species, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Plot of temperature and chirp rate for two species of crickets") +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)') +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)')

species_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp + species, data = crickets)
summary(species_lm)
```
## Species-Specific Chirp Rate Distribution
# Scatter Plot of Temperature vs. Chirp Rate by Species
# This plot visualizes the chirp rate of different species of crickets at varying temperatures.
# A regression line is added for each species.
```{r species_histogram, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = rate, fill = species)) +
  geom_histogram(position = 'identity', alpha = 0.7, bins = 8) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of the Chirp Rate by Species") +
  xlab('Chirp rate (per min.)') +
  ylab("Frequency")
```

```{r interactions, echo= FALSE}
ggplot(crickets, aes(x = temp, y = rate, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  ggtitle("Temperature and Chirp Rate Interaction") +
  xlab('Temperature (Celsius)') +
  ylab('Chirp rate (per min.)')

species_x_temp_lm <- lm(rate ~ temp * species, data = crickets)
summary(species_x_temp_lm)

anova(species_lm, species_x_temp_lm)
```

```{r diamonds, echo= FALSE}
data(diamonds, package = "ggplot2")
diamonds_lm <- lm(price ~ carat + cut + clarity, data = diamonds)
summary(diamonds_lm)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
